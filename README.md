Supercollider Highlighter
=========================

**Supercollider Highlighter** is a PHP library that applies syntax colour-coding to Supercollider code files for presentation on the web. It was designed for the [Supercollider a day project](http://www.adamjansch.co.uk/sc-a-day/) and is based on code from Scott Hewittâ€™s [ChucK Highlighter](http://www.ablelemon.co.uk/chuckhl).

Usage
-----

1 Copy sc_highlighting.php and sc_highlighting.css to your directory.
2 Call `sc_add_stylesheet()` to add the formatting stylesheet. Use a string as the argument to add a prepath.
3 Call `sc_highlighter()` with the path to your Supercollider code file as the argument. Code will be placed within `<pre>` tags automatically.
